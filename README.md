# ALGORITHM VISUALIZER

#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/cv2L9kDIC3E>

#### Description: This is the repository for my CS50 final project. The goal of this project is to better understand the algorithms we discovered throughout the course and their complexity by visualizing them. The concepts demonstrated are:
#### - Linear search : An array of 8 numbers within the range [1, 16] is created. The algorithm searches for the number you entered by checking each index step by step. There is a 50% chance that the number you entered is not in the array. In that case, the website will explain that the number is not present. If not, the number you entered will turn green once it is found.
#### - Binary Search : An array of 15 numbers within the range [1, 30] is created. The algorithm searches for the number you entered using binary search logic. Since binary search is much more powerful, even with a larger array, the target can be found faster. If the number is not in the array, the steps are still shown and explained. If not, the number you entered will turn green once it is found.
#### - Bubble sort : Unlike the search algorithms, bubble sort doesnâ€™t look for a number, but instead helps you understand how sorting works. An unsorted array of 6 numbers within the range [1, 100] is created. Each pair of adjacent elements is compared (highlighted in pink), and if the second number is greater than the first, the boxes turn blue and swap positions. The algorithm repeats this process until the entire array is sorted (green).
